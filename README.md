# Deep Learning Resources

Hey everyone!

This repository contains a structured collection of resources that helped me get started with deep learning, particularly in my research projects.

If you are beginning your journey in this domain, I hope you find these materials equally helpful and insightful :)

Feel free to share or suggest additional high-quality resources that could benefit others as well.

P.S. Iâ€™m still updating this repository whenever I find time :p
